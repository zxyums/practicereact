Based on the additional requirements provided by the client, I will extend the UI design document to address the following points:
	1.	Visual Guidelines (Appendix Section)
	2.	Design for Pagination Feature
	3.	Design for Tab Feature
	4.	Design for Form-Level Autocomplete Components
	5.	Action Sequence Diagram

Extended UI Design Document

Appendix Section: Visual Guidelines
	1.	Typography:
	•	Primary Font: Arial, sans-serif.
	•	Font Sizes:
	•	Headers: 16px-18px.
	•	Body text: 14px.
	•	Table Content: 12px-14px.
	•	Font Weight: Use bold for titles and action buttons; regular for table data and labels.
	2.	Color Palette:
	•	Primary Color: Blue (#0047AB) for buttons and active states.
	•	Secondary Color: Gray (#F8F9FA) for background and borders.
	•	Warning Color: Red (#CC0000) for error messages and notifications.
	3.	Icons:
	•	Use SVG icons for sharp resolution.
	•	Tooltips must accompany every icon for accessibility (e.g., “Edit”, “Delete”).
	4.	Spacing and Padding:
	•	Buttons: Minimum padding of 10px horizontally and vertically.
	•	Table Rows: 8px vertical padding for better readability.

Design for Pagination Feature
	1.	Layout:
	•	Place pagination controls at the bottom-right of the table.
	2.	Elements:
	•	Current Page: Displayed as a highlighted number.
	•	Navigation Buttons:
	•	Arrows for navigating to the next/previous and first/last pages.
	•	Disabled state for unavailable actions (e.g., “Previous” on page 1).
	•	Page Size Selector: Drop-down with options (e.g., 15, 30, 50 rows per page).
	3.	Behavior:
	•	Dynamically update the table data based on the current page.
	•	Smooth transitions for page changes without reloading the entire page.
	4.	Style:
	•	Selected Page: Bold number with a blue background.
	•	Hover State: Change arrow colors to blue on hover.

Design for Tab Feature
	1.	Structure:
	•	Tabs are horizontally aligned, directly beneath the header.
	•	Each tab represents a logical section (e.g., “FLU Assessment”).
	2.	Active Tab:
	•	Highlighted with a red underline and bold text.
	3.	Inactive Tabs:
	•	Use gray text with no underline.
	•	Switch to active state when clicked.
	4.	Responsiveness:
	•	On smaller screens, transform tabs into a dropdown menu for better usability.

Design for Form-Level Autocomplete Components
	1.	Input Field:
	•	Text box with a dropdown arrow icon.
	2.	Autocomplete Dropdown:
	•	Appears below the input field upon typing.
	•	Displays suggestions based on user input.
	3.	Behavior:
	•	Suggestions dynamically update with each keystroke.
	•	Keyboard navigation enabled (up/down arrows to select, Enter to confirm).
	4.	Validation:
	•	Display a red outline and error message if the input is invalid or empty upon submission.
	5.	Style:
	•	Suggestions: White background with a light gray hover effect.
	•	Selected Suggestion: Blue background with white text.

Action Sequence Diagram

Scenario: Submitting an Assessment

User --> UI: Clicks "Submit to GES"  
UI --> Backend: Sends selected row data for validation.  
Backend --> UI: Returns validation results (e.g., success or error).  
UI --> User: Displays success message or highlights errors in red.  

	1.	Start: User selects rows in the table and clicks “Submit to GES”.
	2.	Validation: Backend validates the data (e.g., required fields, format).
	3.	Response: If successful, the system confirms submission; otherwise, it shows an error.
