Since you have AG Grid Enterprise 29.1.0 and cannot upgrade your license, you need to downgrade AG Grid React to match the enterprise version. Follow these steps carefully.

Step-by-Step Guide

1. Uninstall Current AG Grid Packages

Since your ag-grid-react version (31.3.2) is newer than your ag-grid-enterprise (29.1.0), you must uninstall the current versions first:

npm uninstall ag-grid-react ag-grid-community ag-grid-enterprise

This ensures a clean installation without version conflicts.

2. Install AG Grid 29.1.0

Now, install version 29.1.0 of AG Grid packages:

npm install --save ag-grid-react@29.1.0 ag-grid-community@29.1.0 ag-grid-enterprise@29.1.0

This makes sure all AG Grid packages are at the same version.

3. Register Your Enterprise License Key

In your main entry file (index.js or App.js), before rendering the grid, add the license key:

import { LicenseManager } from 'ag-grid-enterprise';

LicenseManager.setLicenseKey('YOUR_LICENSE_KEY');

Replace 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' with the actual key you received.

4. Update AG Grid Imports

Ensure your AG Grid imports are correct:

import { AgGridReact } from 'ag-grid-react';
import 'ag-grid-community/styles/ag-grid.css';
import 'ag-grid-community/styles/ag-theme-alpine.css';
import 'ag-grid-enterprise';

5. Test Enterprise Features

Now, confirm if AG Grid Enterprise is working correctly by using features like row grouping or pivoting:

const columnDefs = [
  { field: "athlete", rowGroup: true },
  { field: "age" },
  { field: "country" },
];

const gridOptions = {
  columnDefs,
  rowGroupPanelShow: "always",
};

If the grid loads with row grouping, your Enterprise version is active.

6. Restart Your App

After installing and setting up the license key, restart your development server:

npm start

Check the browser console for any AG Grid license warnings.

7. Verify the License is Working
	•	If there are no warnings like “No License Key Found”, the setup is correct.
	•	If you see license-related errors, ensure:
	•	The license key is correct.
	•	The key is added before rendering the grid.
	•	You have restarted the application.

Final Notes
	•	Since your Enterprise license is for 29.1.0, always use the same version for ag-grid-react, ag-grid-community, and ag-grid-enterprise.
	•	If you ever get a newer license, you can upgrade AG Grid to the latest version.
	•	If you see any issues, let me know the error message so I can help troubleshoot.
