Subject: Re: Outstanding Job on the File Upload Functionality Testing in SSIT Tool

Hi Kiran,

Thank you so much for your kind words and recognition. I truly appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the project, and it has been a great experience working on File Upload, SSO Token Implementation, Progress Bar, and Tab Functionality.

A special thanks to Dipali as well for her guidance and support throughout the process. The successful completion of the UAT phase and the positive feedback from clients wouldn’t have been possible without the collaborative effort of the entire team.

I’m grateful for the opportunity and look forward to contributing to more successful projects in the future.

Best Regards,
[Your Name]

This keeps it professional, appreciative, and acknowledges both the opportunity and Dipali’s contribution. Let me know if you’d like any modifications!
